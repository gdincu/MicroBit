These tutorial sheets are designed to give students an introduction to the features of the
Micro:bit.  Short practical examples are provided and students are invited to design solutions to problems
using the fundamental building blocks presented. 


Teaching students to code by using a microprocessor and embedded sensors 
on the board, was an approach inspired by Prof. Stephen Hailes at UCL. (His team also designed the Engduino, see <http://www.engduino.org>).
Steve created the teaching material for the Engduino and some of that content is reused here.  The design of the Micro:bit was strongly influenced by the
Engduino and some of this material is taken directly from the Engduino tutorial sheets.
Likewise, in some places, the content is an abridged version of the
BBC Micro:bit MicroPython documentation at <http://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io>.

The Challenge sheets can be used for team competitions or just for fun! Some of them were adapted from the 
exercises by M. Atkinson on the website Multiwingspan, <http://multiwingspan.co.uk/micro.php>.
